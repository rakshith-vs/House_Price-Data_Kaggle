# ML_Models
This was one of the first datasets that I worked on. Realised that this is one of the most used dataset across the datascience community.
This repository consists of the house_price_data csv file which was sourced from kaggle and a python notebook that contains the code that I have written as a part of my learning/practice.
It is an example of supervised learning where I built a Linear Regression Model to predict the sale prices (which is the output variable).
Performed all the preprocessing steps like:
Dropping columns with more than certain % of missing values and filling others with less percentage.
Scaling continous and categorical variables.
Eventually built a Linear Regression Model and measured the R2 score to check accuracy
